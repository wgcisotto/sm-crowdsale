# Crowdsale Smart Contract

Crowdsale is a process through which investors fund a Dapp by buying tokens issued by the organization that’s developing it. 

Depending on the amount of money you contributed and whether the project was successful, you might have been given an early version of the gadget, or you might have been given a considerable discount on the final official price of the product. (reward-based crowdfunding) 

Lately, a new crowdfunding scheme called crowdsale has emerged, mainly geared toward the funding of startup companies. Rather than being given a discounted product or service in recognition for your early contribution, you’re offered some equity in the venture, generally in the form of a monetary token similar to SimpleCoin, whose value the organizers can set before the sale starts. Often, the token or coin crowdsale is called an initial coin offering (ICO)
